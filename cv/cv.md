Publications
-----------------

2016 
:    Yaroshenko, I., [*On Robust Algorithm for Finding Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Generalized Inverse Gaussian Distribution*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10958-016-3035-3), Journal of Mathematical Sciences, 2016, Vol. 218, N. 3, p. 354-362 
		<br/><br/>

	In this paper, we propose robust numerical methods for finding the maximum likelihood estimation of the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. A comparative analysis of the existing algorithms and the results of numerical experiments are presented. Special attention is paid to reproducibility of the tests.
